1)	mkdir – p school

2)	cd school opens the parent folder

3)	nano: 

Created four .txt files and saved them by using ctrl+O, renaming them each time)
 
4)	Created three folders by using the command “mkdir - toolsb CS1 CS2” (I already had the “tools” from a previous exercise.


5)	Copied the .txt -files into the correct directory

cp cmnd.txt ~/toolsb/
cp lecture.txt ~/CS1/
cp lecture2.txt ~/CS2/
cp java.txt ~/CS2/

6)	Moved the three directories to the parent directory

mv ~/toolsb ~/school
mv ~/CS1 ~/school
mv ~/CS2 ~/school


Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too
