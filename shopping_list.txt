1)	mkdir – p school

2)	cd school opens the parent folder

3)	nano: 

Created four .txt files and saved them by using ctrl+O, renaming them each time)
 
4)	Created three folders by using the command “mkdir - toolsb CS1 CS2” (I already had the “tools” from a previous exercise.


5)	Copied the .txt -files into the correct directory

cp cmnd.txt ~/toolsb/
cp lecture.txt ~/CS1/
cp lecture2.txt ~/CS2/
cp java.txt ~/CS2/

6)	Moved the three directories to the parent directory

mv ~/toolsb ~/school
mv ~/CS1 ~/school
mv ~/CS2 ~/school
